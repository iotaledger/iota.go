# iota.go

Official Go library.

This library allows you to do the following:

- Create blocks with tagged data and transaction payloads
- Get blocks and outputs
- Sign transactions
- Generate addresses
- Interact with an IOTA node
- Act as a foundation for Go based node software

If you need to have more sophisticated account management, have a look
at [wallet.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs) for which we also provide bindings in Python and JavaScript.
